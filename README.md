# DevOps Playground: Novemeber 2021 - Container Security

Welcome to the Playground repository for Container Security! 

This playground features two scenarios, which are both included in this repository.

## Instances

You will be provided with three instances via the [Devops Playground Lab](https://lab.devopsplayground.org/) if you have signed up for the Playground.

Only one instance is listed on the above page, but the following example and table should help you identify your instanaces.

Example: feasible-1-panda.devopsplayground.org

This will be used for the first scenario, [privilege escalations](priv).

The second instance will be feasible-2-panda.devopsplayground.org and this will also be used for the [privilege escalations](priv/README.md) scenario.

The third instance will be feasible-3-panda.devopsplayground.org which will be used for the second scenario, [Snyk vulnerability scanning](snyk/README.md)
